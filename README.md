MaxwellBloch is a Python package for solving the coupled Maxwell-Bloch
equations describing the nonlinear propagation of near-resonant light through
thermal quantised systems such as atomic vapours.

Above is an [example solution][4pi] for the propagation of a 4π pulse through a
dense atomic vapour. The pulse immediately breaks up on entering the medium and
the resultant pulses form two optical solitons each with a pulse
area of 2π.

## Documentation

Docs for the project are at [maxwellbloch.readthedocs.io][docs].

## Install

I recommend using Conda environments. 

You can create and activate an environment named `mb` with all the required
dependencies for MaxwellBloch with
```sh
conda create --name mb -c conda-forge python=3 numpy=1 scipy=1 qutip=4
conda activate mb
```
The MaxwellBloch package can then be installed from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/MaxwellBloch/) using

```
pip install maxwellbloch
```

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the [docs][docs] along with many example problems.
