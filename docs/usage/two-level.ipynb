    "## Shifting to the Fixed Frame of Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "We solve the problem in a frame of reference that moves with the speed of light across the medium. This means we can keep time in the system separate from distance, which makes the coupled equations easier to solve. We can also see all the important details of the solution in this frame of reference, as in the plots above. But if we want to look at how a field actually propagates in time, we need to shift back to a fixed (or laboratory) frame of reference. To do that we need to connect the time and space dimensions via the speed of light in the system. The utilities for this shift are in the `fixed` module."

If I put that speed in to the simulation results above, you will see no difference in the output. It will be too fast, and appear that the pulse progresses through the medium instantanously. Instead we can put in a slow speed-of-light to get an idea of what the shift does, say $10^{-5} c$. Something like looking at the pulse in slow motion."
